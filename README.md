Python Data Structure and Algorigthm Playbook

# Greedy Algorithm

easy solution at that point in time without considering

- Travelling Salesman Problem
- Prim's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
- Kruskal's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
- Dijkstra's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm

# Divide and Conquer

dividing the given problem into smaller sub-problems and then solving each

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Kruskal's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
- Binary Search

# Dynamic Programming

bigger problem into smaller ones , the results of smaller sub-problems are remembered and used for similar or overlapping sub-problems

- Fibonacci number series
- Knapsack problem
- Tower of Hanoi

# Linear Data Structure

1. Array ⇒ sequential data element
2. Linked List ⇒ link each other array
3. Stack ⇒ FILO
4. Queue ⇒ FIFO
5. Matrix ⇒ two dimentional arrays

# Non-Linear Data Structure

1. Binary Tree ⇒ connected to maximum two other data elements and it starts with a root node
2. Heap ⇒ parent node is either strictly greater than/ equal to or less than it’s child nodes
3. Hash Table ⇒ keys rather than index. Key : Value
4. Graph ⇒ arrangement of vertices and nodes where some of the nodes are connected to each other through links
